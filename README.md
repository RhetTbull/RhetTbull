### Hi there 👋
- 😄 I'm a self-taught hobbyist who codes in my spare time
- 🔭 I’m currently working on reverse engineering Apple Photos to enhance my [osxphotos](https://github.com/RhetTbull/osxphotos) python package--come take a look!
- ⚡ I've written useful stuff in JOVIAL, BASIC (TRS-80 Level I, GW-BASIC, QBASIC, Visual Basic), Pascal, Fortran-77, C, ASM, AppleScript, Perl, Ruby, and Python.  My latest crush is Python 🐍.
- 🌱 I’d like to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)...just waiting for the right project.
